# Internationalization (i18n) Spec

Shared spec for multi-language support across all targets.

## Principle

All user-facing text must be externalized to language dictionaries. No hard-coded strings in UI code.

## Dictionary Format

Nested JSON with dot-notation keys:

```json
{
  "section": {
    "key": "Translated text",
    "with_param": "Hello {{name}}"
  }
}
```

## Interpolation

Dynamic values use `{{param}}` syntax:

```
"balance": "Balance: {{amount}}"
```

Usage: `$t('balance', { amount: '$1,234.56' })` → `"Balance: $1,234.56"`

## Locale Detection

1. User preference (stored in settings)
2. Browser/device locale
3. English (fallback)

## MVP Scope

- English dictionary only
- All strings externalized
- Infrastructure ready for additional languages

## Future Languages

- Spanish, French, German
- User-contributed translations
- Pluralization support
