## Backlog (Priority Order)

### High Priority (MVP Blockers)

#### ✅ Transaction Search (Story 06) - Phase 1 Complete

**Phase 1: Transaction Browser** (Ready for Imbalance Debugging)
- ✅ Create consolidation for search screen
- ✅ Build `TransactionResultsTable.svelte` component (reusable)
- ✅ Create `/search` route
- ✅ "Show All Transactions" button
- ✅ Transaction grouping (header + split rows)
- ✅ Debit/Credit columns with proper alignment
- ✅ Totals row with balance verification
- ✅ Entity column (cross-entity view)
- ✅ Account column with hyperlinks
- ✅ Export to CSV/Excel with proper decimal formatting

**Phase 2: Query Builder** (Future)
- ⬜ Visual query builder interface
- ⬜ Field selection (entity, account, memo, date, amount, etc.)
- ⬜ Operators per field type (<, >, =, contains, wildcard, regexp)
- ⬜ AND/OR logic with grouping (indentation)
- ⬜ Query preview/validation
- ⬜ Save/recall named searches
- ⬜ Edit/duplicate/delete saved searches
- ⬜ Export results to CSV

**Why Phase 1 first:** Provides immediate debugging tool for imbalance investigation. Phase 2 builds on the results table.

#### ✅ Fix Balance Sheet Imbalance (Complete)
**Issue:** Equity total didn't include Retained Earnings
- ✅ Fixed backend: `totalEquity` now returns equity accounts only (not including net income)
- ✅ Added `totalIncome` and `totalExpense` to balance sheet data
- ✅ Fixed frontend: Equity total in both modes now includes Retained Earnings
- ✅ Retained Earnings shown under Equity in both modes:
  - **Balance Sheet:** Expandable to show Income/Expense breakdown
  - **Trial Balance:** Non-expandable line item (I/E already shown separately)
- ✅ Verification formula: Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Net Income (works for both modes)
- ✅ Removed Net Worth display (redundant with Equity)
- ✅ Balance Sheet: Balanced
- ✅ Trial Balance: Balanced

#### ✅ Clarify Trial Balance vs Balance Sheet
**Resolution:** Stories and specs updated
- Balance Sheet: Shows A/L/E only, RE expandable under Equity to show I/E subcategories
- Trial Balance: Shows all 5 types (A/L/E/I/E) at top level, no RE expansion needed
- Income Statement: Shows I/E with Net Income calculation line
- Updated: Story 04, `design/specs/web/screens/accounts-view.md`

#### ✅ Income Statement Date Range (Complete)
**Implementation:** Income Statement and Cash Flow now support date ranges
- ✅ Updated `BalanceSheetData` type with `startDate` and renamed `asOf` to `endDate`
- ✅ Updated backend SQL query with conditional date filtering:
  - A/L/E accounts: cumulative through endDate (ignores startDate)
  - I/E accounts: period-based (startDate to endDate) when startDate provided
- ✅ Frontend conditional date picker:
  - Balance Sheet & Trial Balance: single "As of" date
  - Income Statement & Cash Flow: "From" and "To" dates (vertically stacked)
- ✅ Auto-sets default start date (Jan 1 of current year) for period-based modes
- ✅ Vertical date stack styling (prepares for multi-column reports)

#### ✅ Account Hyperlinks Everywhere
**Issue:** Account names should be clickable throughout
- ✅ Retained Earnings breakdown (I/E accounts)
- ✅ Split transaction entries in ledger
- ⬜ VBS click-through (future enhancement)
- ⬜ Search results (when implemented)

#### ✅ Settings Screen (Complete - Compact Design)
**Implemented with auto-save behavior and compact UI**

Features implemented:

- ✅ Light/dark/system theme toggle (immediate effect)
- ✅ Language selector (English only for MVP, dropdown ready for future)
- ✅ Date format with live preview (US/EU/ISO)
- ✅ Account display format (Code/Name/Path/Code: Name)
- ✅ Simplified sign toggle (hide negatives for Equity + Income together)
- ✅ Sereus nodes list UI (empty state, "+ Add Node" button for future)
- ✅ Settings persist in localStorage
- ✅ Auto-load on app startup

**Dark theme improvements:**
- ✅ Better contrast for disabled elements (improved in Accounts View)
- ✅ Improved global `text-muted` color (#6e7a8a)
- ✅ More visible borders (#3d4751)
- ⬜ Test all screens in both themes
- ⬜ Consider separate dark theme color palette

- Persist state

#### ⬜ Print/PDF Report Rendering
From story 04:

- Better color schemes and contrast
- Hover states with detailed tooltips
- Click-through to account details
- Handle edge cases (zero balances, negative equity)
- Optional Ring 3 (individual accounts)
- Scroll events to zoom in/out

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)

## Schema & Design Reference

### Core Decisions (Resolved)

**D1: Signed Amounts**
- Single `amount` field: positive = debit, negative = credit

**D2: Entry-Level Tags**
- Tags on Entry (not Transaction) for split transaction support

**D3: Units Model**
- Generalized from "Currency" to "Unit" (currencies, crypto, commodities, inventory)
- `displayDivisor` for non-decimal units (time, dozens)

**D4: Retained Earnings**
- Pseudo-account (not in DB)
- Calculated as: Income - Expense from inception

**D5: AccountGroup Hierarchy**
- `parentId` on AccountGroup for hierarchy
- AccountType enum still used for top-level categorization

**D6: Account Hierarchy**
- `parentId` on Account (per-entity hierarchy)
- Example: "Bank of America" → Checking, Savings

**D7: Imbalance Account**
- Each entity has system "Imbalance" account
- Flagged prominently in reports
- Cannot close period with Imbalance balance

### Open Questions (For Future Iteration)

**Q1: Attachments** — How to store receipts/invoices? (Entity vs Sereus file handling)

**Q2: Recurring Transactions** — Template system for subscriptions, payroll?

**Q3: Invoice/Bill Entity** — Formal AR/AP tracking vs simple transactions?

**Q4: Opening Balances** — Special transaction type or regular dated entry?

**Q5: EntityGroup** — Formal consolidation sets or UI-driven ad-hoc selection?
