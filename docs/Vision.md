# Bonum Vision

## Purpose

Bonum helps individuals and organizations manage their financial lives with clarity, structure, and confidence. It provides a streamlined way to track assets, liabilities, income, and expenses, while supporting richer forms of collaboration and oversight.

## Philosophy: Balance Sheet Thinking

Many personal finance programs have focused on **checkbook management** — helping people spend less than or equal to what they earn. While this promotes living within one's means, it may not help people to *build wealth*.

Bonum takes a **balance sheet approach**. This teaches users to manage and grow their net worth, not just their cash flow.

**Example:** In balance sheet accounting, purchasing a valuable asset (a vehicle, equipment, property) may not decrease wealth at all — even though it decreases cash. The asset simply moves from one form to another. Checkbook-style thinking would show this as pure expense.

## Built on Sereus Fabric

Bonum is built on the [Sereus Fabric](https://sereus.org), a peer-to-peer network inspired by the Latin *serere* — "to join, interweave, connect."

This architecture provides:

- **Safer Storage:** Joining additional cadre nodes provides redundancy and resilience. If a device is lost or damaged, data persists with the rest of the cadre.
- **Collaborative Access:** Sereus facilitates both read and write access for multiple people simultaneously.
- **Selective Sharing:** Data can be shared with professionals such as accountants, auditors, bookkeepers, or business partners — with fine-grained permissions.

Your financial data remains yours — but can be woven seamlessly into the financial workflows of those you trust.

## Comparable Software

Bonum should be roughly comparable to:
- Quickbooks
- GnuCash
- Xero
- Wave

...but with a decentralized, user-controlled architecture rather than cloud-vendor lock-in.
